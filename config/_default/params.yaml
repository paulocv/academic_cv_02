    description: 'I am a Computational Epidemiology researcher specializing in data-driven models to help addressing public health challenges. With a PhD in Physics, I bring expertise in programming and advanced tools for modeling contagion dynamics through agent-based, age-structured and metapopulation simulations, as well as statistical analysis. My work is fueled by curiosity and a commitment to efficiency, so I am continuously learning new skills and tools that enhance productivity for myself and my team. My goal is to improve public wellbeing delivering precise evidence to inform decision-making on infectious diseases.'
