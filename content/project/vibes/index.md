We developed a multiscale agent-based model that combines within-host viral dynamics and between-hosts transmission dynamics. The viral dynamics model is fed with longitudinal viral load data of patients infected by the target pathogen, and it drives the infectiousness and disease progression in the transmission model.

More information on this project will be added in the future.
