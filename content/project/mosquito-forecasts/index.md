## Rationale
We developed an analytical tool to forecast the relative abundance of mosquito species in urban areas. I was the lead developer and first author 
in the first version of this project. 

The tool is a mechanistic and Bayesian framework, which estimates reproduction and generation parameters of a mosquito species based on 
weekly specimen collection data. We trained and validated our framework for _Aedes aegypti_ collections in four urban locations of the USA 
with diverse climate landscapes. 

## Publications 

Our first paper was published in [Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012671) in 2024:
