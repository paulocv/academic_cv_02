      - Research area: Computational Epidemiology.
      - Team: Laboratory for Computational Epidemiology and Public Health (CEPH Lab) 
      - Supervisor: prof. Marco Ajelli
      
      My main role is to develop and manipulate computational models for the spread of infectious diseases and related phenomena. 
      These models range from mechanistic (agent-based, compartmental, age-structured) to statistical (data analysis, Bayesian methods)
      and are designed to address public health questions such as: 
      - Transmission patterns of respiratory diseases and the impact of interventions
      - Dynamics and forecasting of mosquito abundance in urban areas
      - Incidence forecasting of respiratory diseases (influenza, COVID-19, RSV)
      - Daily patterns of human exposure to mosquito bites.

awards:
  - title: Graphic Design Specialization
    url: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/graphic-design
    date: '2023-11-25'
    awarder: Coursera | California Institute of the Arts

    summary: |
      The goal of this specialization is to equip learners with a set of transferable formal and conceptual tools for “making and communicating” in the field of graphic design. This core skill set will equip learners for formal studies in graphic design, and a starting point for further work in interface design, motion graphics, and editorial design.
#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#      Learned:
#      - Synthesize your own blockchain solutions
#      - Gain an in-depth understanding of the specific mechanics of Bitcoin
#      - Understand Bitcoin’s real-life applications and learn how to attack and destroy Bitcoin, Ethereum, smart contracts and Dapps, and alternatives to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm

#    awarder: datacamp
#    icon: datacamp
#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

[//]: # (## About Me)

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Indiana University, USA, supervised by [prof. Marco Ajelli](https://publichealth.indiana.edu/research/faculty-directory/profile.html?user=majelli). 
With a background in physics, my [current research](/projects) is in Computational Epidemiology focused on respiratory and vector-borne diseases in humans.
During my PhD I worked with complex systems and contagion dynamics, having done a one-year internship with [prof. Yamir Moreno](https://cosnet.bifi.es/people/yamir-moreno/) in Zaragoza Spain.
