        - Agent-based modeling of respiratory infectious diseases, aimed at understanding transmission patterns, addressing the impact of interventions (e.g. contact tracing, individual isolation, vaccination) and testing new modeling frameworks. 
        - Bayesian approach to forecast the incidence of respiratory diseases, collaborating with the CDC forecasting initiatives.
        - Statistical analysis of human time use data and mosquito diel activity, revealing daily patterns and social determinants of human exposure to mosquito bites. 
        - Bayesian approach to forecast the abundance of _Aedes aegypti_ in urban areas of the United States â€“ adapted from the methodology used for respiratory diseases. 
        
        

#        I am a Computational Epidemiology researcher specializing in data-driven models to help addressing public health challenges. With a PhD in Physics, I bring expertise in programming and advanced tools for modeling contagion dynamics through agent-based, age-structured and metapopulation simulations, as well as statistical analysis. My work is fueled by curiosity and a commitment to efficiency, so I am continuously learning new skills and tools that enhance productivity for myself and my team. My goal is to improve public wellbeing delivering precise evidence to inform decision-making on infectious diseases.
        
#        Use this area to speak to your mission. I'm a research scientist in the Moonshot team at DeepMind. I blog about machine learning, deep learning, and moonshots.

#        I apply a range of qualitative and quantitative methods to comprehensively investigate the role of science and technology in the economy.
